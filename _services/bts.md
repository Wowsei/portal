The English name is "Break Through Starter" and the abbreviation is "BTS".

This course focuses on the process of leveraging technology to advance your business. Evolve your business with goals, strategies, methodologies, toolsets, technology, and more.

G2Rail is a project launched over the past three years that provides ground transportation booking services for international travelers. As a team member with a technical background, this experience made me deeply reflect on the role of technology.

I realized that it is not enough for engineers to learn the basics well and master programming languages; they also need to ``breakthrough'' in business. Technology should be the starting point, penetrate business, and ultimately drive the evolution of business through technology, constantly drawing out innovation at the boundary between business and technology.

This training is a three-day program in which participants practice developing business applications to realize business intent. This process is part of the G2Rail real-world experience.

#### Course Format and Content

This course begins on the evening of the 0th day. Participants will help form teams and go through eight sprints (some of them working late into the night). After completing the course, participants will be able to develop and release a travel industry app from scratch, or have already released one.

For example, in the first sprint, it is necessary to realize "Germany Xintian Castle Admission Ticket Reservation". Through the business-to-technical process, participants will gain an introductory understanding of industry knowledge and an introductory knowledge of related technologies to develop apps using Flutter. At the same time, you can gain business-based experience in order to think about what role technology plays in business.

Over the next eight sprints, you will have a three-day commercial app iterative experience through series modules such as 'Swiss Passport Booking', 'Switzerland Point-to-Point Train Booking', 'Building a Growth Funnel' and 'Expanding to International Markets'. . You can gain experience in realizing your business while constantly tackling challenges and learning from them.
