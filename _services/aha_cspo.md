There are two important parts to product development - **Discovery** and **Delivery**

* **Discovery** means exploring ideas, validating ideas, iteratively improving, and disseminating these ideas for exponential growth.
* **Delivery** refers to ensuring the implementation of an idea with a development team, releasing in stages and iteratively, and creating an MVP (minimum value product) in order to release it as soon as possible. means to identify.

We will learn about Discovery and Delivery processes, tools, practices, and activities (meetings) and how to leverage them as a Scrum Product Owner.

During this course we will try to answer the following questions:

* As a product owner, what product development processes, tools, and practices do you have that are helpful to you? What are the expected outcomes? What are the common pitfalls?
* Why are these (processes, tools, practices, activities) useful?
* Who will be involved in these?
* When will these take place?
* How do you launch a new product? What is the flow from idea to product backlog item? How do these proceed?

##### Day 1 * Balance Between Discovery & Delivery

Product development is divided into two parts that go back and forth * Discovery and Deliver. Discovery means how to find exponential growth ideas, how to make these creative ideas use social networks to speed up dissemination and amplification; Delivery means how to ensure linear growth, how to efficiently implement ideas, how to verify, how to implement, how to find MVP, How to combine with agile methods such as Scrum, how to iterate. These are two parts that complement each other and are inseparable. Therefore, the three-day course design of the CSPO course is also based on these two parts.
